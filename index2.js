// object activity 2 on slack


//1. Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
//2. Create multiple recipes and store them as an array, so we can iterate over them later.
//3. Add a function to each of the objects that returns a string: 'here is a recipe for -- and it serves --, these are the ingredients --, --, --, --' (try using a loop)
//4. Iterate over all the recipes console.log the function we just created for each iteration adn you should see all your recipes in the console.
